#User has to upload video which is more than 1GB. Users network bandwidth is too low. Network get dropped after 50% upload. User tries again and same thing happens. Now to design an optimized efficient solution to address this issue.

1. Option to downgrade the quality of video (this will save bandwidth)

2. Save the file in local file system and notify the user that he will get notification once the upload is complete. This frees up the app/system.


3. Save the job info in a database, so that in case system reboots, we can start the upload process from where it was left.


4. Upload was successful, notify the user.


In case of timeout, error, max-retries, notify the user.
