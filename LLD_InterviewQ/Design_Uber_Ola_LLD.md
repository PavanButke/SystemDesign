# Cab Booking like Uber, Ola

## Problem Statement

### We want to build a cab booking platform to allow a rider to book a cab.

## Details:
The location is represented as a (x, y) coordinate.
Distance between two points (x1, y1) and(x2, y2) is sqrt((x1-x2)^2 + (y1-y2)^2)

Platform has decided upon maximum distance a driver has to travel to pickup a rider.
A cab has only 1 driver.
Sharing of cab is not allowed between riders
There is a single type of cab
Please build an application that exposes following features to riders and drivers.

1. Register a rider.
2. Register a driver/cab
3. Update a cab's location
4. A driver can switch on/off his availability
5. A rider can book a cab
6. Fetch history of all rides taken by a rider.
7. End the Trip
## Expectation from this round
1. Demonstrable code is first expectation. To do this, you can choose any interface you are comfortable with - CLI, WebApp, MobileApp, APIs or even simply run the code via Tests or a main method.
2. Code should be extensible.
3. Clean professional level code.
4. Functional Completeness including good modelling.
5. User Identification but not authentication.
6. Backend Database is optional. However modelling should be complete.
